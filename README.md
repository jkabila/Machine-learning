# KMeans-cluster
What is K-Means Clustering?
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a set of clusters. The goal of K-Means is to group data points into clusters such that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other compared to those in other clusters. It is widely used for tasks like customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

How does K-Means Clustering work?
The K-Means algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K clusters based on the nearest mean (centroid). The steps involved in the algorithm are as follows:

Initialization: Randomly choose K data points from the dataset as initial centroids.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
Update: Recalculate the centroid of each cluster based on the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, i.e., centroids do not change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
Usage
To use K-Means Clustering, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.

Prepare Data: Prepare your dataset in a suitable format. Ensure it is preprocessed and scaled if necessary.

Instantiate KMeans Object: Create a KMeans object specifying the number of clusters (K) and any other parameters like maximum iterations or convergence tolerance.

Fit Data: Fit the KMeans object to your dataset using the fit() method.

Retrieve Results: Once the algorithm converges, you can retrieve the cluster labels for each data point using the labels_ attribute.

Analyze Results: Analyze the clustering results and interpret the clusters formed.
